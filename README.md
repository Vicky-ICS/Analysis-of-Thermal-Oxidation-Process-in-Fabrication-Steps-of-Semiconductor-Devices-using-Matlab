# Analysis-of-Thermal-Oxidation-Process-in-Fabrication-Steps-of-Semiconductor-Devices-using-Matlab
Analyzed the thermal oxidation process by observing the transient characteristics behaviour of developed oxide thickness at semiconductor wafer surface concerning changes in temperature during oxidation.<br /> 
Repeated the same characterization Steps For both thermal oxidation process defined as: Wet oxidation and Dry oxidation.<br />
